I'm realizing more and more than I am getting interviews from companies that has nothing to do with React and Redux.  My last two interviews had to do with C#, PHP, Python, and SQL (not just Rails Active Record).  I believe one of the few reasons why I am getting these type of jobs is that I am just not skilled enough.  It may also have to do that my portfolio is still in process of being developed.  Should I be taking these jobs even though I want to be a React/Redux developer?  Would I even be able to get an offer from these non-React jobs?

Also, I find that the newer startups really care more about how the website looks than its functionalities.  Often times, I get asked questions like, do you have any portfolio projects that focus more on the design?  Unfortunately, mine does not.  I guess this makes sense.  When customers visit a company's website, the initial visual may actually cause the customer to leave if it does not look great.  This is a highly unfortunate scenario, for Flatiron School does not heavily focus on design.  

I have only just entered second month of job searching, yet I have ton of information on what to do to make myself more desirable to startups.  Since I am looking towards getting a job with a startup company, I need to make sure I am desirable by a startup company.  I have a lot to do, but I am excited to see how many portfolio would turn into in a week or two.
