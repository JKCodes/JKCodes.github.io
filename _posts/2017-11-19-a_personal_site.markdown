One interesting I noticed while looking for a job is that a lot of applicants had really nice looking website.  So, being a curious person myself, I started to look around recently hired junior developer's GitHub and what separated them from a grad like me.  One thing I immediately realized was that their projects are beautiful.  They are very well thought out, and they are practical.  I immedately realized that while my projects are technical, they lacked the practical use in the real world.  So, for the next week, I have decided to finish up my personal site, which will mostly focus on aesthetics, and a new project that will be more practical instead of a random ecommerce app that I had created.  I am excited to see what my projects will look like by this time next week.
