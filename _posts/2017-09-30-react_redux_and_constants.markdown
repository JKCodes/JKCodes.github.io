Today, I went to a React/Redux meetup that featured a live React/Redux demo.  It was a fast paced demo, but thanks to the amazing React/Redux module from The Flatiron School, I had no problem following along with the demo.  There was, however, one thing that was covered at the demo that was not covered at The Flatiron School, and that thing was something called Constants.  The idea behind the constants was that instead of putting the error prone action types (due them being strings) in many different action files, the constant file holds all of the strings in one file so that when a new action needs to be added, there is only one file to edit without ever having to search around many action files.  I thought this was very smart, for strings are very brittle.  I learned something neat today, and I can't wait to see what I learn next!
