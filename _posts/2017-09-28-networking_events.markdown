Instead of writing one gigantic post once per week, I have decided to write a shorter blog post once per one day or two days from now on.  What this means is that the blog will most likely be one or two paragraphs, but it will contain one or maybe two major point during that very day.  The problem I faced when I wrote one blog per week was that, I no longer remembered what happened five or six days prior to that date.  I want to be able to look back and read my old blog and see what I had done on a specific day.  

Yesterday, I went to my very first networking event at The Flation School.  It was pretty crowded, and it was very loud.  I did expect to see a large number of people, but it was surprising to see how outgoing people were.  I have always had trouble jumping into a group of people in order to introduce myself.  So the whole night, I found myself looking for a lone person to talk to.  Surprisingly though, I did talk to quite a large number of people this way as well.  I got to meet other recent graduate, and this one employer gave me some helpful tips on what to study and what to do to distinguish myself from my Flatiron graduate competitors.  All in all, it was an exciting opportunity, and I hope there are more opportunities like this again in the future.
