Recently, while I was looking around to see what I can do with my new knowledge of React, I stumbled upon React Native.  Making mobile apps using React sounded like a great thing, and for the most part, it really is.  However, because I already know Swift, I found something that might be an issue.  JavaScript is a pretty brittle language compared to Swift.  Inundated with null values and the ways that JavaScript handles out of bounds indexes on arrays unfortunately makes any frameworks that use JavaScript brittle as well.  In addition, from hours of researching, many complex tools that I could use in Swift are either not available yet or does not work very well yet.  These issues are definitely some issues that I found while learning React Native.

On the other hand, React Native is great because it allows the developers to create apps for both Android and iOS phones at the same time.  That's a huge amount of time and money savings.  For some developers, this alone is enough to create mobile apps using React Native.  In addition, React Native builds on top of React, so knowing React Native will also pretty much require knowing React.  As we all know, React is used to build web apps.  Thus, not only can knowing React be useful in making web apps, knowing React will help learning React Natvie.  In the end, knowing React will allow users to build both web apps and mobile apps.  Now that is pretty awesome.
