Where is my formula sheet?  I search my notebook.  I look everywhere inside my backpack, but it is nowhere to be found.  However, at that moment, I realize something that changes my life forever.  Why don’t I just program  those formulas into my graphing calculator?  It was never supposed to be anything more than storing those formulas on my calculator, but that day, I realized something.  I found out that I loved coding.  Soon after that day, I found myself making text games on my graphing calculators, and not even six months after that, I had started my very first AP course in high school: Computer Science.  

Fast-forward many years, here I am still being driven by my, now-realized, passion of coding.  I believe programming to be a perfect blend of struggles and rewards.  I’ve already have had my own share of frustration, looking completely stunned at lines of codes that do not seem to have any errors, but only to find out later that I had accidentally used ‘=‘ instead of ‘==‘ on an if statement.    However, the joy and the sense of accomplishment of creating an app that solves some of life’s mysteries… now that makes all the struggles worth it.  Each time I make a mistake and learn from that mistake, I feel myself evolving into an even better programmer.  So, there really isn’t anything negative about making a mistake!  

Beginning this Full-Stack Development is not my starting point in my journey, and it surely won’t be the last.  Before joining Flatiron School’s Full-Stack Web Development Course, I already had already made few cool looking iOS apps.  In fast, mobile development is also something I picked up due to my passion for coding.  My next big goal is to become great in Full-Stack Development, iOS Development, and Android Development. 

Words can’t possibly explain how excited I am about starting my Full-Stack Development journey.  In order to become great at something, one must possess love and passion for that something.  This passion and love will push him or her through all obstacles and reach levels of accomplishments that would be impossible otherwise.  This is true for me.  If I didn’t have love and passion for coding, I would have never made this far, and I certainly would not be writing this blog.
