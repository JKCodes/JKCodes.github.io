For the past few days, I have been working on creating apps that incorporates more readily usable features such as Google Maps, rss feeds, and external apis.  One thing I had not considred at all while creating my ecommerce app was using already available external apis.  It was few days of intense learning experience, and I am excited to declare that I was successful!

One thing I realized while creating my Newsfeed app and Podcast app was that even though JSON is most readily used, a lot of apis actually returned xml.  Thus, I had to convert my xml into json.  This introduced extra level of complexity to my apps, but I can certainly say that it was been an amazing learning experience.
