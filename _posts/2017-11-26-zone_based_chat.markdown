I just recently started a new app that will plug users into a chat room based on the user's zone.  The idea behind this app is to let users have fun talking to others about whatever they wish.  This could also mean that some users may say something rude or inappropriate, so some amount of content moderation may be needed.  However, that is an issue that will be addressed after an MVP is released.  

The project will use Redux/React, Node, and Mongo (this one is a maybe).  I haven't decided if this app will focus on design, or whether this app will focus more on functionality (or perhaps both).  However, this is a portfolio project that I plan on adding to my list of apps on my portfolio site, so I do not plan on spending too much time on it.
