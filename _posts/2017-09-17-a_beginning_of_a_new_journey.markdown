It has been roughly three weeks since I had graduated from The Flatiron School, and I have finally begun my job searching.  Now, I had the privilege of being invited to The Flatiron School's on-campus recruiting, and the experience of being at The Flatiron School was very memorable.  There are three things that I learned this week, and I thoroughly enjoyed the learning experience as well.

First, I realized that what I had learned from The Flatiron School was indeed current.  What I mean by this is that, one thing I really wished that my university would have taught was a more technologically current programming language.  Now, I am not saying that learning C++ was a totally waste of my time, for learning C++ really did build a great foundation on Object-Oriented Programming.  However, what I am talking about is that, I wish my university would have taught some JavaScript frameworks such as Angular and React.  After graduating, I expected everyone would still be coding in C++, but I soon realized that my university's education was not very current.  

Second, I found out that cultural interview is very hard and has a steep learning curve.  I am trying to 'educate' my interviewer about who I am and so forth, but I found it very difficult to talk about myself proficiently.  However, I did find myself getting better and better at telling others by myself, and I really do believe that the experience of having attended on-campus recruitment at The Flatiron School really did make me a better applicant!

Last, I found that there are ton of recent graduates who are in the same position as me.  This means that my competition is fierce, but this also fuels me even more to become even better applicant.  I already see myself looking at ways to give myself an edge over my applicants, and I honestly thrive in these situations.  I really enjoy competition, for competitions only turns me into a better programmer.

Overall, I am very satisfied with my last week, but I now understand that I'm going to work hard to realize my dream of becoming an excellent programmer.  I know this is only the beginning, but somehow, it feels like I've been doing this for months already.  Well, in a sense, I have already been doing this since late May.
