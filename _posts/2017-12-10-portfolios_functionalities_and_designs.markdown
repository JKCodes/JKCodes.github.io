One question I seem to get often has to do with the balance between the functionalities and design factors.   Did your project focus more on designs, or did your project focus more on functionalities.  So, where is the good line between too much functionalities and too much design?  Is there a such line at all?  Doesn't this depend on the employer?

From the past few months looking for a job, I'm starting to get a good idea of what the employers are looking for in a candidate.  More often than not, design trumps functionalities.  This is especially the case for start ups.  I am sure for big companies functionalities are far more important.  I truly believe that if someone's project doesn't look great, that person won't even make it past the first round of interviews.  I'll continue to monitor what the employers want, but I definitely see that for startups, design is definitely greater than functionalities.
