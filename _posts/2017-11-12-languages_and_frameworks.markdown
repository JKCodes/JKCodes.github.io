I recently picked up Node JS and Mongo Db.  One interesting thing I found was that as I learn more and more languages and frameworks, it becomes increasingly easier to pick up new languages and frameworks.  I honestly had thought that it would tka me weeks to learn Node and Mongo, but it took less than one week to learn both of them.  

Another thing I also realized was that different companies use different framework and languages.  Because I thought that React was the most popular framework at the moment, I automatically assumed that every company is either using React or would like to transition into React.  However, I often find out that older companies tend to continue using their old (and often outdated or non-popular) languages and frameworks.  I wonder why this is the case?
