I like reading about the latest technology trends, and I like coding.  So why not build a simple CLI app that can satisfy both of these conditions at once?  Well, that's what this application is.  Although this app is not meant to be super impressive or sophisticated, but there are often times when I wish I can just get a quick list of articles that I can read instead of having to scroll down for few seconds because there are so many ads and pictures in the website.  I mean, I understand why those ads and pictures are there, but for me, it feels like those pretty graphics and animations only get in the way of choosing my next article to read.

So, here is what the app actually does.  It scrapes the latest twenty articles from a web site.  It then creates a nice and quick list of those articles that only contains the title, author, and the published date.  I can then quickly peruse the list and choose the article I find interesting.  Next, upon selecting an article, I am then presented with a short synopsis (about two paragraphs or so) of what the article is about.  If this sounds interesting, I would then have the app open up the actual article in the web browser.  However, if it doesn't sound interesting, then I just go back and try another one.  

I've learned a great deal from making this app.  First, setting up the environment took me much longer than expected.  The reason for this definitely has to do with the fact that I created this app to be a gem.  However, somewhere down the line, I started to feel quite weird about publishing an app that contains another person's hard work, so this gem will never be published.  However, I do like the idea of having a published gem, so I'll definitely publish a different gem in the future.  Second, refactoring is an ongoing process.  Even though I purposefully coded this app to avoid refactoring, I still had to refactor a bunch anyway.  Refactoring is great, so this is not a bad thing at all.  Finally, I thought all CLI apps to be useless, but I found out that CLI apps can also be very useful and have practical uses.

My full-stack journey continues, and I'm so excited to see what I'll learn in the future!
