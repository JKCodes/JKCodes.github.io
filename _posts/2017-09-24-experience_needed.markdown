There is one thing that I'm realizing as I continue my search for a job.  I have never once expected the job searching to be easy; however, I also never realized the difference in demand between those with experience and those who do not yet have any professional experience.  Two years of experience seem to be the "normal" minimum even for an "entry" level position.

But, how can this be?  Let's think logically here.  If almost 95% of jobs require minimum of 1+ years of experience (it might even be greater than 95%), how will employers possibly fill those spots consistently?  Every person age, and even though the tech field is still quite young, people will retire eventually (or people may decide to change careers).  Thus, if employers start with the rather insane 1+ years of minimum experience for entry levels, the rate of hiring new developers will eventially be much less than the rate of developers retiring.  Sure, there will be ton of job openings, and one may even complain that there aren't enough skilled developers. However, isn't one of the reason why that is happening is that not enough developers are reaching the "correct" level of experience, because not enough companies are willing to take any risks and invest in a new developer?  

There is also a chance that there still may be very large number of experienced applicants looking for a job, but I see three things happening in the future.  1)  More and more companies will finally drop the insane 1+ years of experience on entry level jobs. 2) There will no longer be enough skilled developers and the number of "open" jobs will continue to increase. 3) Companies will start looking in different countries for skilled developers, but in the end, will this not hurt the US economy?
