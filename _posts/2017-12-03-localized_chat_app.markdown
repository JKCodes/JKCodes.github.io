When I started creating a localized chat app few weeks ago, I never thought that it would be so complicated.  React, Redux, and the need for the components to speak to one another, I get that.  However, once I introduced database and the myriad number of errors that arose from dealing with server-side rendering, the project became very completed very quickly.  On paper, server-side rendering sounds easy.  Just send some initial store data from the back-end to the front-end... How hard can it possibly be?  Well, it was a rather frustrating experience.  When I watched some videos on server-side rendering, the videos used react router version 3, but the newer react router version 4 is very different from its older predecessor.  Not a single thing that was mentioned on the video worked, and I found myself looking through pages of documentation to even get the page to stop throwing a 500 error.  However, as with anything, practice and perseverance reigns triumphant.  It was a long and arduous process, but it sure was a great learning experience.  Now, what should I learn next?  Time to go research!
